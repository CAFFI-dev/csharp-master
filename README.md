# csharp-master
Collection of my programs, that made on C# (not UNITY!!!)
1) CAFFI - I don't know yet what is this.
2) ConsoleApp1 -- Tic Tac Toe v.0.7;
My third project that was made with C# Windows Forms without the internet.
3) JustAFunProgram
My unfinished program that was made just for fun ;)


Why I need this repository?
'cause I always forgot my programs everywhere, and it will help me to coordinate better.
Also git is useful for team work, so it's very useful


So it's the end of the .md file ;)

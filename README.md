# csharp-master
Collection of my programs, that made on C# (not UNITY!!!)
1) Tic-tac-toe 0.7
My third project that was made with C# Windows Forms without the internet.



Why I need this repository?
'cause I always forgot my progrms everywhere, and it will help me to coordinate better.
Also git is useful for team work, so it's very useful


So it's the end of the .md file ;)
